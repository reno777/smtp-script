# smtp-script
mail server script

This is a simple mail server script I wrote for ISTS 2017. This sets up the postfix/main.cf file and dovecot/dovecot.conf file as well as iptables for what we needed during the competition.

This also installs all the packages we needed on the box we were using which was a fedora 21.
